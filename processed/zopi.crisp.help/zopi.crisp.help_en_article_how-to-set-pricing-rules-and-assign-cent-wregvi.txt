To make a profit, your selling price must be higher than what your supplier charges you. At Zopi, you can take advantage of the Pricing Rules feature to automate the pricing for your products. Read below to learn how to set it up in just a few steps.This article covers the following parts:Set Pricing RulesSet Assign centsSet Taxes for ProductsLet’s dive in!Set Pricing RulesYou can simply follow this instruction for setting up pricing rules for your products and it will be applied after you have saved it.   Login to Zopi > Settings & Billing > Product.In the Price set up tab, turn on Auto pricing.Click on the ration button to select your desired pricing rule type.There are 2 options: Basic Pricing Rule and Advanced Pricing Rule (Available from the Advanced plan and above).Option 1: Basic Pricing RuleThis allows you to use a fixed number to add to or multiply by the product cost and set the result as the product selling price. Product cost: The price of the product on the AliExpress page. Selling Price: the prices you want to show on your storefront. You can use "Multiply" or “Plus” techniques to optionally set products price to ensure your wishful profit. + Multiply: Multiply the original product price as many times as you want. For example, a product that costs $2.00 from an AliExpress supplier with a “multiply” of 3 would have the price of $6.00 in your Shopify store.   + Plus: Plus allows you to add a new price on top of the original product price. For example, a product that costs $2.00 with a “plus” of 3 would have a price of $5.00 in your Shopify store.  Compare At Price: This will help you to create artificial product sales in your Shopify store. Just add your desired “Multiply” or “Plus” to set up. Disable this button if you don’t want to show the comparing price. But take note that the "Comparing Price" value must be set higher than the "Product Price" setting value. Option 2. Advanced Pricing RuleThis allows you to apply a comprehensive pricing formula to price your product prices shown in your stores. Cost range: You can add a cost range to set your new product prices. This feature is especially effective when you are selling different types of products and their cost range is really wide. You can add more than 1 cost range using the “Add cost range” button to set the most reasonable prices for your products.For example: + From the range 0 USD to 10 USD, please click to choose Plus method or Multiply method next to Product Price, and then add the additional price.+ From the range 10.01 USD to 20 USD, please click to choose Plus method or Multiply next to Product Price, and then add the additional price.Then:+ If your product A on AliExpress is 2 USD, you set up the Product Price with Plus: 10 => then, this product will be on Shopify for 12 USD.+ If your product B on AliExpress is 15 USD, you set up the Product Price with Multiply: 2 => then, this product will be on Shopify for 30 USD.Follow the same steps as above for "Compare At Price” or you can hide this feature if you don't need it by unchecking the box.Set Assign cents Zopi allows you to set a specific cent value for your price.For example, the product costs $5.70 (on AliExpress), and you have the Pricing Rules set to multiply by 3 times, the product price will be calculated like this: $5.70*3= $17.1 but if assign cents set to 99, then product price will be 17.99 on your store. Set Taxes for ProductsHere we have the option to set products as taxable.You can use this feature by checking the Set products as taxable box.Finally, click on the Save button to save and apply the newly saved pricing rules to all your upcoming imported products. After importing products by rule, you can go to Imported products and customize prices if needed. Please note that the newly saved rules only applied for new imported products, it DOES NOT apply for products that already existed in the "Listed products" or after you push it to your store.

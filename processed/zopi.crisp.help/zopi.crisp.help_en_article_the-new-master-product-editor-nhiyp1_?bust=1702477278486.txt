Here is what’s new: Product Editor  Zopi uses the same interface as Shopify, making it easy to edit product details. As of now, editing product content has never been simpler or more effortless. First, you can click on the product name or tap the pen symbol in the actions area. This will open a window where you can customize the list of products. 1. AI Writing  The AI tool can automatically create a clear and descriptive product name, optimize your product descriptions and SEO content when you click on the Generate. You can add the link of another product from other content sources for reference (only AliExpress or Temu links are valid). Before saving, you can go back to the previous version of the product details. You can also select the language and content to apply AI writing.   2. Optimize image  With AI Image finder, you can explore amazing and quality images powered by AI. It also allows you to attach your logo to the product (such as Promotion or Flash Sale) and change the images to Webp format for optimal speed. You can always press the turn off button to go back to the image without the logo.   3. Split product  If there are multiple variants of a product and you want to sell some products as single items or in smaller groups, you can easily split the variants. To use this feature, you can either click on the icon or select it from Bulk action.   4. Add more variants:  With Imported product: Also, you can use Add Supplier Variant to add more variants from a supplier that you split. Make sure you save to apply your edits.    With Mapped product: Once the product is pushed successfully, you’re still able to Add a Store Variant by creating a new variant on the store that differs from the supplier’s variant. Then, the new variant needs to be remapped to the original one. The variant image can be selected again by clicking on it.    The above guide shows you how to easily update your product details. Hope it can help you with your online store development.
